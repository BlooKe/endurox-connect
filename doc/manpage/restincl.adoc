NAME
----
restincl - EnduroX HTTP REST incoming call handler (HTTP Server, XATMI Client)


SYNOPSIS
--------
*restincl*


DESCRIPTION
-----------
This is XATMI client which accepts HTTP/HTTPS REST requests, calls the XATMI server
specified in configuration. The binary works with go routines (very cheap threads).
But the number of concurrent invocations to XATMI sub-system is limited by *workers*
initialization configuration flag. In case if all workers are busy, the incoming thread
will wait for the XATMI worker to become free.

The configuration is defined in mixed for with INI and JSON formats. The
configuration file contains keys which value can be set as multi-line JSON.
Configuration file contains *defaults* key which defines the default parameters for
the route. Then when new route is added, firstly it is initialized from defaults
and then additionally it is overridden by route it self.

Incoming HTTP REST server (XATMI client), supports multiple buffer formats and
different error handling schemes. Buffer formats can be:

. *json2ubf* - JSON Converted to UBF XATMI buffer type;

. *json* - JSON text directly set in UBF JSON buffer type;

. *text* - XATMI Typed String buffer format. Incoming text is copied to String buffer;

. *raw* - XATMI Carray buffer format; The incoming data is copied to Carray buffer type;


The error handling can be done in following ways:

. *http* - mapped HTTP error codes are being used for indicating XATMI failure codes;

. *json* - XATMI error codes are projected to JSON text root level two fields:
code and message;

. *text* - The error code is printed in output response buffer text by using format
specified in config;

. *json2ubf* - The error code is set in Enduro/X standard buffer fields and later
Converted to JSON buffer.


The operation modes of the REST interface can by:

. Synchronous - with http call XATMI services are invoked in Synchronous mode, waiting
for the sub-system answer or timeout that provides the corresponding response error
code.
